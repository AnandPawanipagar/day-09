        <p>
        <h3 class="sideheading">#1. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</h3>

        <div class="para">
            PWA is probably one of the most impactful trends in web development. It pushes the world
            wide web forward making
            website browsing experience closer to native mobile applications and, therefore, more friendly to users.
            <br>
            In a nutshell, PWA is a website which, however, offers functionality traditionally available to native apps
            (e.g. push notifications, offline access, hardware access).

        <h3 class="sideheading">#2. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</h3>

        <div class="para">
            Google takes serious steps to enhance the mobile browsing experience. The company first introduced
            Accelerated Mobile Pages Project to publicity back in 2015 and nowadays it’s one of the latest trends of web
            technologies.
            <br>
            What is it? This technology is created to encourage building websites that load instantly and work very
            smoothly across mobile devices. AMP pages are loaded for about 2 seconds vs. up to 22 seconds for non-AMP
            pages.

        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3 class="sideheading">#3. Responsive Websites</h3>

        <div class="para">
            While web development trends for 2021 are being populated with rather new technologies like PWA and AMP,
            such relatively old ones as responsive web design are still out there on the scene.
            <br>
            The difference is that years ago it has been a good-to-have feature and now it’s obviously must-to-have. As
            said, the overwhelming majority of users prefer mobile devices over any others. Regarding that, Google is
            planning to add mobile-first indexing. That means the website’s ranking will depend on how well it’s
            optimized for mobiles. (You can find more details on that on the official page.)

        <h3 class="sideheading">
            #4. Voice Search Optimization</h3>

        <div class="para">
            Voice search is another trend you can’t afford to overlook. It already has a great impact on the web and
            more is yet to come. According to Gartner, about 30% of all searches will be done without using a screen by
            2021. Not to mention the number of smart speakers which is rising year over year. The Activate outlook
            suggests there will be about 21.4 million of them in the United States by 2021.

            Consequently, voice commerce sales are also expected to grow dramatically and reach $5 billion in the UK and
            $40 billion in the US by 2022.
            <br>
            Taking into consideration multiple studies and actual market situation, voice search optimization is the web
            development trend you cannot ignore. It should become a part of your SEO and tech strategy as soon as
            possible. Early adopters are always ahead of the competition

        <h3 class="sideheading">#5. API-First Development</h3>

        <div class="para">
            Current trends in website development suggest that web solutions have to be well-prepared for connectivity
            with other applications. It’s no surprise considering the rise of mobiles, wearables, and other devices that
            should integrate with one another. That’s where the tendency for API-first development approach comes from.
            <br>
            What’s wrong with traditional approach? When a company’s main focus is to build a web or mobile solution
            they usually don’t pay much attention to API development. At best, it comes as a side project that might not
            be properly designed and tested.
